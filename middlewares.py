"""
Agent middlewares — hooks that run at specific points in the agent loop.

Middlewares are the harness engineer's primary tool for shaping agent behavior
without changing the core loop. They intercept execution at defined points:

  - post_tool:    After a tool call completes. Use for loop detection, tracking.
  - pre_exit:     When the agent wants to stop (no more tool calls). Use for
                  forced verification passes.
  - per_iteration: At the start of each iteration. Use for time budget warnings.

Middlewares return an optional message to inject into the conversation.
Returning None means "no intervention."

Design principle: middlewares are composable and profile-specific.
The base Agent loop knows nothing about terminal tasks or time budgets —
profiles wire in the middlewares they need.
