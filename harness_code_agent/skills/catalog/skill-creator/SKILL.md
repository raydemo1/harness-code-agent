# Skill Creator

Create the smallest repository skill that adds reusable judgment or procedure. This workflow edits only `harness_code_agent/skills/catalog/`; global Codex and agent skill directories are out of scope.

## 1. Establish the need

Read the request, search the current catalog, and inspect adjacent skills. Prefer updating or composing an existing skill when the proposed capability overlaps. Do not create a skill for one-off facts, generic advice, or behavior already enforced by code or tests.

Choose the invocation surface deliberately:

- **Model-invoked:** omit `disable-model-invocation`; the concise description enters the stable prompt and the body is loaded on demand.
- **User-invoked:** set `disable-model-invocation: true`; the registry exposes `/name` dynamically and inlines the body only when invoked.

## 2. Design the skill

Use a lowercase kebab-case directory whose name exactly matches frontmatter `name`. Provide a specific `description`; add `argument-hint` only when arguments are useful.

Keep `SKILL.md` focused on decisions and procedures that change behavior. Move substantial templates, examples, or reference material into sibling files and point to them explicitly. Compose another catalog skill through `read_skill_file("catalog/<name>/SKILL.md")`; do not refer to Claude's Skill tool or assume a global installation.

Do not add provider-specific agent metadata. Do not copy an upstream skill blindly: retain only the parts compatible with VeriForge's tools, authorization rules, and repository workflow.

## 3. Implement and validate

After editing:

1. Instantiate `SkillRegistry` and confirm discovery succeeds with no duplicate or invalid metadata.
2. Confirm the skill appears on the intended model or user invocation surface.
3. Load its body and required sibling files through `read_skill_file`.
4. Add or update focused catalog tests, including a negative or boundary case when behavior changed.
5. Search for stale names and incompatible invocation instructions.
6. Run the focused test suite and `git diff --check`.

Report the invocation surface, files changed, validation evidence, and any intentionally excluded upstream behavior.
