    """
    Detects common error patterns in tool output and injects specific,
    actionable recovery suggestions.

    Weak models struggle to recover from errors on their own — they often
    retry the same failing command or give up. This middleware matches
    error patterns and provides concrete next steps.

    Based on TB2 command-level error analysis:
      - 24.1% of failures: command not found / not on PATH
      -  9.6% of failures: runtime errors in executables
      -  High rate: permission denied, missing dependencies
